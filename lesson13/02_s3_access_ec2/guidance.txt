Talk about how some buckets will require --region based on the region

Copy a file to a bucket
aws s3 cp LOCALFILE s3://BUCKET

Copy a directory structure recursively to a bucket
aws s3 cp ./directory s3://BUCKET --recursive

Copy files from one bucket to another
aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET1/OBJECT s3://BUCKET2/
