Modify the security group to allow all inbound from self if the rule doesn't exist
(assuming amazon linux or redhat)
sudo yum install amazon-efs-utils

Navigate to the EFS service dashboard and click "File systems" on the left hand nav
Click on the demo-efs name link
Click "Attach"
Copy the command under "Using the EFS mount helper"

Switch back to the EC2 terminal and issue the following:
mkdir /efs
Paste the command copied earlier and add a "/" before efs
