While logged in using the Root account credentials:
Click on Account and show where to enable IAM user/role access to billing information
Click on Security Credentials
Show where Root Access Keys might be configured, and make sure there are none
Navigate to the IAM service dashboard and select "Users" on the left-hand nav
Click on "Add Users"
Type in a user name
You must pick either or both of the Access Key or Password for credentials
If you select Password, you have other options for autogenerating the password
If you select "Require Password Reset", you must make sure the user has permission to do that
Click "Next:Permissions"
You now have options for permissions, which will be discussed in the next Lesson
Permissions can be left blank to be added later if desired
Copying permissions from an existing user is a convenient way to duplicate permissions
Click "Next:Tags"
You may now add up to 50 key/value pairs that act as metadata
These tags can be used for filtering/sorting, and permissions support them
Click "Next:Review"
Ensure all values are correct and click "Create User"
