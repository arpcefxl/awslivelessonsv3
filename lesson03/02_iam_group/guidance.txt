Navigate to the IAM service dashboard and select "User Groups" on the left-hand nav
Click "Create Group"
Enter a group name
You can choose to add existing users to the group now or later
Scroll down further and view the existing policies which can be attached to the group
Only Managed policies can be attached at group creation
Inline policies must be added after creation (we will discuss these in the next lesson)
