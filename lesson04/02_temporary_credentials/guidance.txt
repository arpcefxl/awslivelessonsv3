Click on the top left AWS icon in the AWS console
To the right of the search bar is a small icon labeled "CloudShell"
Click CloudShell and accept the initial notice if you're executing for the first time
This tool is a way for you to avoid install/configure tasks for the AWS CLI
Execute the following command in the CloudShell tool:
aws sts get-session-token --duration-seconds 900
The command response will be a JSON object with temporary credentials
The permissions will be the same as your IAM user, with the expiration in the seconds specified
You could use these credentials in the AWS CLI or SDK in an application
If you receive the following error:
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetSessionToken operation: Cannot call GetSessionToken with session credentials
This means you are logged into the AWS console using temporary credentials already
This could be specifically an IAM Role or possibly federated identity
